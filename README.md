A basic GitHub repository example for new [Call for Code](https://developer.ibm.com/callforcode/) projects and those that join the Call for Code with The Linux Foundation deployment initiative. Not all sections or files are required. You can make this as simple or as in-depth as you need.

## Short description

### What's the problem?

Are you aware that almost 50% of the world’s population, including that of developed countries, is dependent on groundwater for drinking? 

Physical, Chemical, and Biological Contamination of groundwater have led to <em> 1 in 3 people globally not having access to safe drinking water, this is as per UNICEF and WHO report of 2019 </em>. Consumption of contaminated water leads to numerous health complications from dysentery to severe kidney damage.
The biggest problem is the lack of frequent monitoring and its communication about the Degradation of a Water source not just to the authorities but to the community too.  

### How can technology help?

With IoT devices, frequent water quality monitoring becomes automated and thanks to open-source web technologies, this information can be made accessible to every individual who is using a water source. Integration of IBM Cloud and Watson services enables us to not just inform about the degraded groundwater source but also informs the community about the purification methods whenever required. Understanding patterns from collected Data can be employed to reduce lab test dependency for approximate assessment. 

### The idea

<font style="color:#4F46E5" type="Roboto"> Saaf</font> <font type="Roboto"> water </font> is an end to end Open-source platform which when installed will:
1. Timely monitors groundwater and informs authorities as well as the community about water quality along with purification methods for consumption.
2. Predict when the water quality will go bad.
3. Reduce dependency on manual test kits or lab tests for approximate assessment.

## The architecture

![Video transcription/translation app](https://developer.ibm.com/developer/tutorials/cfc-starter-kit-speech-to-text-app-example/images/cfc-covid19-remote-education-diagram-2.png)

1. The user navigates to the site and uploads a video file.
2. Watson Speech to Text processes the audio and extracts the text.
3. Watson Translation (optionally) can translate the text to the desired language.
4. The app stores the translated text as a document within Object Storage.

## Long description

## Project roadmap

The project currently does the following things.

- Feature 1
- Feature 2
- Feature 3

It's in a free tier IBM Cloud Kubernetes cluster. In the future we plan to run on Red Hat OpenShift, for example.

See below for our proposed schedule on next steps after Call for Code 2021 submission.
