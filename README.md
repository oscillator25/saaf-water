## Short description

### What's the problem?

Are you aware that almost 50% of the worldâ€™s population, including that of developed countries, is dependent on groundwater for drinking? 

Physical, Chemical, and Biological Contamination of groundwater have led to <em> 1 in 3 people globally not having access to safe drinking water, this is as per UNICEF and WHO report of 2019 </em>. Consumption of contaminated water leads to numerous health complications from dysentery to severe kidney damage.
The biggest problem is the lack of frequent monitoring and its communication about the Degradation of a Water source not just to the authorities but to the community too.  

### How can technology help?

With IoT devices, frequent water quality monitoring becomes automated and thanks to open-source web technologies, this information can be made accessible to every individual who is using a water source. Integration of IBM Cloud and Watson services enables us to not just inform about the degraded groundwater source but also informs the community about the purification methods whenever required. Understanding patterns from collected Data can be employed to reduce lab test dependency for approximate assessment. 

### The idea

<b><font style="color:#4F46E5" type="Roboto"> Saaf</font></b> <font type="Roboto"> water </font> is an end to end Open-source platform which when installed will:
1. Timely monitors groundwater and informs authorities as well as the community about water quality along with purification methods for consumption.
2. Predict when the water quality will go bad.
3. Reduce dependency on manual test kits or lab tests for approximate assessment.

## The architecture

![Saaf water Dashboard](./images/architecture.png)

1. The Saaf water hardware consists of a low power, cellular enabled setup that monitors water parameters like TDS, Turbidity, pH and more and sends it to IBM watson IoT platform.
2. The water parameter data is then collected by the NodeRed backed from the IBM Watson IoT platform and then stored in NoSQL database.
3. The Backend then sends the data via websocket to the Saaf water dashboard deployed on IBM Cloud Foundry.
4. Or users can get the groundwater quality information and purification methods via SMS too.

## Long description

## Project roadmap

The Saaf water currently does the following things.

- Monitors various groundwater parameters like TDS, pH, Turbidity, Electrical Conductivity. 
- Groundwater Quality Prediction.
- Informs authorities as well as community about water quality with purification methods.
